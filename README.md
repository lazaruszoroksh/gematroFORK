# Fork of Gematro

This is a fork of the popular cryptography/gematria calculator called Gematro, hosted at [gematro.com](https://gematro.com).
This fork aims at adding new ciphers as fast as possible! In fact, it has been added the QWERTY set of ciphers. 

## List of Modifications

In "calc/calc.js", row 25, I've setted the Extra Ciphers as always visible

```javascript
var optShowExtraCiphers = true // false // enable extra ciphers
```

In "calc/ciphers.js" I've added, at the end of the file, the QWERTY set of ciphers, notably the QWERTY (extended), the QWERTY ordinal and the QWERTY reduced, all with the respective reverse cipher.

## How to contribute

Just drop a pull request with your favorite cipher, the source and, possibly, make a YouTube video explaining why it is important.
The ciphers can be added in the "calc/ciphers.js" file, you can see how the other ones are being implemented.

## Licence

I don't own this code, and this is a fork of the software [gematro.com](https://gematro.com).
